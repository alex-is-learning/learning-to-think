- Following on from [[Israel & Iran (session 1)]]
- I'm gonna read the new post by Peter Wildeford ([The Fordow Paradox: Where do Iran and Israel go from here?](https://peterwildeford.substack.com/p/the-fordow-paradox-where-do-iran?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=30299&post_id=165884951&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=3mr1o&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email))
- And make predictions as I go
# WAVE 1
## 🤔 Predictions
- Reading the first few paragraphs of the blog post and making predictions
- *"Called Operation Rising Lion, this attack involved the Israeli Air Force using over 200 aircraft dropping 330+ munitions on 100 targets. Israeli officials revealed Mossad had established a secret drone base near Tehran months in advance, activating them to destroy missile launchers threatening Israeli cities."*
- ❓Who is Mossad?
- Prediction → head of Israel's military? The top like... the head of the military? I'm realising I don't know who is the "leader" of a country's military!
- 🤔 40% - Mossad is the "secretary of defence" in Israel
- 🤔 20% - Mossad is the top military general in Israel
### Who is the leader of a military?
- I guess the leader of the country is the #1 person
- ❓ But there must be a... I guess it's like, secretary of defence in the US? 
- There must be military person, a #1 general, who has been in the military for essentially their whole career. And then there's a top person in the government, who liases with this person
- ❓ So yeah, I think it's like, Secretary of Defence, and then Head General (idk what you'd call this)
- 🤔 The top military person in the US government is called the Secretary of Defence - 80%
- 🤔 The top military person in the US government interfaces with the top general - that is, there is a top general, a #1 person in the military - 70%
### Seismic shift - why?
- "These attacks represent a seismic shift in a decades-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions."
- ❓Prediction → because no one has _attacked_ Iran's nuclear infrastructure. There have been deals, and sanctions as Iran has flouted the CSA/cancelled the AP, but no attacks
- 🤔 70% → no one has directly attacked Iran's nuclear facilities before
## 💰 Cashing out my predictions
1. **Mossad is the “secretary of defence” in Israel**
    - Confidence: 40%
	- ❌ WRONG !!! Mossad isn't a person !!!
	- "**Mossad is essentially Israel’s version of the CIA**"
2. **Mossad is the top military general in Israel**
    - Confidence: 20%
    - ❌ 
3. **The top military person in the US government is called the Secretary of Defence**
    - Confidence: 80%
    - ✅
    - The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) is the highest-ranking civilian official in the U.S. government responsible for:
		  - Overseeing the entire U.S. military
		  - Directing defense policy
		  - Acting as the chief liaison between the civilian leadership (President/Congress) and the military establishment
	- The Secretary reports directly to the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief.
	- They also supervise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant Commanders.
4. **The top military person in the US government interfaces with the top general — i.e., there is a #1 person in the military**
    - Confidence: 70%
	- ✅ 
	- Yes — in the U.S. military structure:
	  - The top civilian in the government who oversees the military is the Secretary of Defense.
	  - The #1 uniformed military officer is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).
5. **No one has directly attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities before**
    - Confidence: 70%
	- ❌
	1. Stuxnet cyberattack (2010)
	   - A joint U.S.–Israeli cyber operation that physically damaged Iran’s centrifuges at the Natanz facility by sabotaging control systems.
	   - Widely regarded as the first major cyberweapon to cause physical destruction.
	2. Natanz explosion (2020, 2021)
	   - A series of explosions and power outages damaged centrifuge halls.
	   - Iran blamed Israel for covert sabotage operations.
	3. Assassination of nuclear scientists (2010–2020)
	   - Multiple Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, often via car bombings or snipers.
	   - Widely attributed to Mossad.
	4. 2025 Israeli airstrikes (your context)
	   - This marks the first large-scale, overt military strike on nuclear infrastructure.
# 📝 WAVE 1 REVIEW
- I didn't do very well lol, but that's fine, I know barely anything about this! 
- This has taken me ~30 minutes (including writing all of this here) - feels SO much more rich than like "I'll read the entire thing all at once"
- Feels so much more interactive, engaging, adult. I'm still so thrilled about this whole thing! (That is, learning to think)
- All of the above is from the below source text (30 minutes on so few words!!):

> In the early hours of June 13, 2025, [Israeli F-35I Adir stealth fighters crossed into Iranian airspace](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/12/iran-israel-nuclear-us-trump/), launching precision strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz and Isfahan, while conspicuously avoiding the mountain fortress of Fordow.

> Called [Operation Rising Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran), this attack involved the Israeli Air Force using over 200 aircraft dropping 330+ munitions on 100 targets. Israeli officials revealed [Mossad had established a secret drone base near Tehran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/mossad-set-up-a-drone-base-in-iran-uavs-were-activated-overnight-to-strike-surface-to-surface-missile-launchers-aimed-at-israel/) months in advance, activating them to destroy missile launchers threatening Israeli cities.

> **These attacks represent a seismic shift in a decades-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions.**
## Biggest updates
- Damn, Israel's CIA (Mossad (?)) are very effective. Sniping nuclear scientists, covert attacks, stuxnet. 
# WAVE 2
- Ok I'm back after a break, lets read a bit more
## 🤔 Predictions
### The drone base
> "[Mossad had established a secret drone base near Tehran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/mossad-set-up-a-drone-base-in-iran-uavs-were-activated-overnight-to-strike-surface-to-surface-missile-launchers-aimed-at-israel/) months in advance, activating them to destroy missile launchers threatening Israeli cities."

- Not a prediction, but I'm assuming this means they set up a drone base inside Tehran, which is mad.
- I guess this a thing countries do? Covert strongholds within enemy territory? But this seems very surprising somehow. Kinda metal
- ~~🤔 90% - Mossad set up a covert drone base _within Iran_~~
- Tbf, it could be an the border of Iran? That seems more likely
- 🤔 30% instead of 90% → setting up a secret base by Iran's border, in a friendly country, would make a lot more sense/be much less surprising, than actually setting up a base _within_ Iran, without being being detected
	- So to clarify - prediction is that there's a 30% chance that they set the base up in Iran
- 🤔 60% → they set up the drone base in a neighbouring country
### The seismic shift
> "***These attacks represent a seismic shift in a decades-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions.***"

- 🤔 80% → seismic because an attack has never been this blatant. This is the most non-covert, the most obviously attributable to Israel (vs before, stuxnet etc, they've had some deniability)

> "***What makes Israel's response extraordinary isn't just the scale of destruction to nuclear infrastructure, but the simultaneous decapitation of Iran's military and scientific leadership.*"

- Ah ok, so it's not just the blatantness, it's that it was in parallel with other attacks!
- Feels hard to know if I got this right or wrong
- I'll say I got it ❌ wrong - I was overconfident
### Iran is in its weakest position in decades

> Iran finds itself in the weakest strategic position in decades.

- Why? Let's think...
	- Decades of sanctions
	- Fairly recently widespread protests, I think?
	- Maybe Israel is particularly bellicose at the moment?
	- Trump is also belligerent, not a President they can look to for appeasement. He scrapped the JCPOA for one thing. 
	- Also, Israels leader (Netanyahu?) is very bellicose/pugnacious/aggressive
	- International condemnation of Iran enriching uranium, scrapping their involvement in the IAEA's AP, and not fully cooperating with the CSA
- I'm probably missing some other factors here

> **Firstly, the basic military math is brutal** — Iran just doesn’t have the military might to match Israel, with Israel having a much larger and more modern military. On top of that, if Iran gets too out of line, [US B-2 bombers from nearby Diego Garcia](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-announces-more-air-assets-middle-east-2025-04-01/) can easily join Israeli forces.

- Damn, yeah, forgot the "Iran probably has a less effective military than Israel" piece
- Diego Garcia? What the hell is that?
- 🤔 60% → Diego Garcia is a US military base somewhere in the middle east

> **More critically, Iran is fundamentally vulnerable.** Israel’s [Iron Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome), [David's Sling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David's_Sling), and [Arrow systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_\(missile_family\)) can intercept Iranian attacks. But Iran's air defenses lie in ruins after [Israel destroyed most of them in October 2024](https://www.janes.com/osint-insights/defence-news/weapons/israel-attacks-iranian-missile-production-air-defence-sites), allowing Israel to strike most of Iran without interception. And Iran can't replace their systems and weapons quickly. Russia, Iran’s supplier, is burning through its own air defense inventory in Ukraine and can't spare replacements.

- Bah, another thing I didn't think of. "Israel is very hard to attack, Iran is now weakened because of the strikes" (and other recent attacks)
### Spotting a dumb model
- I had a dumb model of like "oh, Netanyahu is just kinda evil, he's very pro-war and hates the Palestinians" etc
- But this blog post makes it clear just how much progress Israel has made re: Iran. They've destroyed Iran's air defences! They've apparently hugely disrupted Hamas (which makes sense), which Iran used/allied with, for proxy warfare. And Assad's regime collapse is another blow to Iran. So actually, it goes from "Netanyahu is just this kind of awful bellicose leader" to "shit yeah they clearly have a mission and it's going well"
- Stupid to operate on the model of "oh that guy is just a bad guy" vs "he seems to be doing terrible things but it must be coherent with a broader strategy", but hey, we're here to learn how to think
### "What does Iran want?"
- There's a whole section about this, but I'm flagging, so I'm gonna leave it there for now. 
- This is definitely a blog post I can spend 1-2 hours per day on over multiple days! Super info rich and useful
## 💰 Cashing out my predictions
1. 🤔 **30%** — There’s a 30% chance the drone base was _in Iran_  
	- ✅ TRUE - the drone was *in Iran*, what the absolute fuck, how do you do that???
2. 🤔 **60%** — The drone base was set up in a neighbouring country (near Iran’s border)  
	- ❌ FALSE
3. 🤔 **80%** — The attack is seismic because it's the most blatant and least deniable Israeli strike against Iran  
	- ❓- I'm gonna give this one an "unresolved"
4. 🤔 **60%** — Diego Garcia is a US military base somewhere in the Middle East
	- ❌ FALSE - it is within striking distance, but it's not _in_ the Middle East, it's actually on a tiny Island in the ocean
		- **Diego Garcia is a U.S. military base**, and an important one at that.  
		- However, it’s **not in the Middle East** — it’s located in the **Indian Ocean**, specifically part of the **British Indian Ocean Territory**, south of the **Maldives**.
		- Despite not being in the Middle East, it **plays a major strategic role in Middle East operations**.  
		- The U.S. uses it as a **long-range bomber base**, including for **B-2 stealth bombers**, which can reach the Middle East quickly from Diego Garcia.
## Biggest update from round 2
- Mossad set up a drone base IN Iran, that is crazy shit

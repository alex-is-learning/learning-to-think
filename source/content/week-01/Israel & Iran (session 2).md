- Following on from [[Israel & Iran (session 1)]]
- I'm gonna read the new post by Peter Wildeford ([The Fordow Paradox: Where do Iran and Israel go from here?](https://peterwildeford.substack.com/p/the-fordow-paradox-where-do-iran?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=30299&post_id=165884951&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=3mr1o&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email))
- And make predictions as I go
# WAVE 1
## Predictions
- Reading the first few paragraphs of the blog post and making predictions
- *"Called Operation Rising Lion, this attack involved the Israeli Air Force using over 200 aircraft dropping 330+ munitions on 100 targets. Israeli officials revealed Mossad had established a secret drone base near Tehran months in advance, activating them to destroy missile launchers threatening Israeli cities."*
- ❓Who is Mossad?
- Prediction → head of Israel's military? The top like... the head of the military? I'm realising I don't know who is the "leader" of a country's military!
- 🤔 40% - Mossad is the "secretary of defence" in Israel
- 🤔 20% - Mossad is the top military general in Israel
### Who is the leader of a military?
- I guess the leader of the country is the #1 person
- ❓ But there must be a... I guess it's like, secretary of defence in the US? 
- There must be military person, a #1 general, who has been in the military for essentially their whole career. And then there's a top person in the government, who liases with this person
- ❓ So yeah, I think it's like, Secretary of Defence, and then Head General (idk what you'd call this)
- 🤔 The top military person in the US government is called the Secretary of Defence - 80%
- 🤔 The top military person in the US government interfaces with the top general - that is, there is a top general, a #1 person in the military - 70%
### Seismic shift - why?
- "These attacks represent a seismic shift in a decades-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions."
- ❓Prediction → because no one has _attacked_ Iran's nuclear infrastructure. There have been deals, and sanctions as Iran has flouted the CSA/cancelled the AP, but no attacks
- 🤔 70% → no one has directly attacked Iran's nuclear facilities before
## Cashing out my predictions
1. **Mossad is the “secretary of defence” in Israel**
    - Confidence: 40%
	- ❌ WRONG !!! Mossad isn't a person !!!
	- "**Mossad is essentially Israel’s version of the CIA**"
2. **Mossad is the top military general in Israel**
    - Confidence: 20%
    - ❌ 
3. **The top military person in the US government is called the Secretary of Defence**
    - Confidence: 80%
    - ✅
    - The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) is the highest-ranking civilian official in the U.S. government responsible for:
		  - Overseeing the entire U.S. military
		  - Directing defense policy
		  - Acting as the chief liaison between the civilian leadership (President/Congress) and the military establishment
	- The Secretary reports directly to the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief.
	- They also supervise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant Commanders.
4. **The top military person in the US government interfaces with the top general — i.e., there is a #1 person in the military**
    - Confidence: 70%
	- ✅ 
	- Yes — in the U.S. military structure:
	  - The top civilian in the government who oversees the military is the Secretary of Defense.
	  - The #1 uniformed military officer is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).
5. **No one has directly attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities before**
    - Confidence: 70%
	- ❌
	1. Stuxnet cyberattack (2010)
	   - A joint U.S.–Israeli cyber operation that physically damaged Iran’s centrifuges at the Natanz facility by sabotaging control systems.
	   - Widely regarded as the first major cyberweapon to cause physical destruction.
	2. Natanz explosion (2020, 2021)
	   - A series of explosions and power outages damaged centrifuge halls.
	   - Iran blamed Israel for covert sabotage operations.
	3. Assassination of nuclear scientists (2010–2020)
	   - Multiple Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, often via car bombings or snipers.
	   - Widely attributed to Mossad.
	4. 2025 Israeli airstrikes (your context)
	   - This marks the first large-scale, overt military strike on nuclear infrastructure.
# WAVE 1 REVIEW
- I didn't do very well lol, but that's fine, I know barely anything about this! 
- This has taken me ~30 minutes (including writing all of this here) - feels SO much more rich than like "I'll read the entire thing all at once"
- Feels so much more interactive, engaging, adult. I'm still so thrilled about this whole thing! (That is, learning to think)
- All of the above is from this source text. 30 minutes on so few words!! 

> In the early hours of June 13, 2025, [Israeli F-35I Adir stealth fighters crossed into Iranian airspace](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/12/iran-israel-nuclear-us-trump/), launching precision strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz and Isfahan, while conspicuously avoiding the mountain fortress of Fordow.

> Called [Operation Rising Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran), this attack involved the Israeli Air Force using over 200 aircraft dropping 330+ munitions on 100 targets.

## Biggest updates
- Damn, Israel's CIA (Mossad (?)) as very effective. Sniping nuclear scientists, covert attacks, stuxnet.
